For the course "Python for Machine Learning" by Uplimit, the Week 2 project is to learn how to clean a DataFrame and merge one DataFrame into another.

## Project Overview

## Data Visualization
We visualize this week dataset with an Streamlit app that allows us to adds filters to our dataset.

### Streamlit Visualization
We are using Streamlit to create and host our interactive visualization.
