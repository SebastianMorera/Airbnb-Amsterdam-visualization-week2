# Explore AirBnB Amsterdam
Project 2: Explore AirBnB Amsterdam
For the course "Python for Machine Learning" by Uplimit, the Week 2 project is to learn how to clean a DataFrame and merge one DataFrame into another.

## Project Overview
In this project, we are using Pandas to clean the AirBnb Amsterdam dataset. We worked with Google Colab to write and run our Python code and visualize the dataset using Streamlit.

## Data Visualization
We visualize this week dataset with an Streamlit app that allows us to adds filters to our dataset.

### Streamlit Visualization
We are using Streamlit to create and host our interactive visualization.

## Course material week 2 summary
- Introduction to Pandas:
  - A Python library for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

- Key Features:
  - Manages large datasets better than Excel.
  - Auto-detects data types and handles missing data.
  - Easily merges and combines datasets.

- Pandas vs. NumPy:
  - Handles mixed data types in 2D tables (DataFrames).
  - Supports named columns for easier access.
  - Uses more memory but provides more features.

- Using DataFrames:
  - DataFrames are like Excel tables with rows and columns.
  - Simple commands to explore and manipulate data (head(), info()).
  - Indexing with labels (.loc) and positions (.iloc).

- Data Cleaning and Merging:
  - Fill or drop missing data easily.
  - Merge datasets like SQL joins (inner, outer, left, right).
