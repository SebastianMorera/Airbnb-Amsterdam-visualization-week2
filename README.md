Project 2: Explore AirBnB Amsterdam
For the course "Python for Machine Learning" by Uplimit, the Week 2 project is to learn how to clean a DataFrame and merge one DataFrame into another.

## Project Overview
In this project, we are using Pandas . We worked with Google Colab to write and run our Python code and visualize the dataset using Streamlit.

## Data Visualization
We visualize this week dataset with an Streamlit app that allows us to adds filters to our dataset.

### Streamlit Visualization
We are using Streamlit to create and host our interactive visualization.
Here is the link to visualize the project:

## Course material week 2 summary
- Introduction to Pandas:
  - A Python library for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

- Key Features:
  - Manages large datasets better than Excel.
  - Auto-detects data types and handles missing data.
  - Easily merges and combines datasets.

- Pandas vs. NumPy:
  - Handles mixed data types in 2D tables (DataFrames).
  - Supports named columns for easier access.
  - Uses more memory but provides more features.

- Using DataFrames:
  - DataFrames are like Excel tables with rows and columns.
  - Simple commands to explore and manipulate data (head(), info()).
  - Indexing with labels (.loc) and positions (.iloc).

- Data Cleaning and Merging:
  - Fill or drop missing data easily.
  - Merge datasets like SQL joins (inner, outer, left, right).
